## Task approach

I started by installing the gems I knew I would need. I installed rspec for writing tests, I would usually install factory bot alongside it but at this point I don't think I will need any models as I will just be pulling data from the recipes API. I will probably either use WebMock or VCR to mock the API in tests but will decide that when I start writing them. I also installed blueprinter for JSON serialization and HTTP party for making http requests to the MealDB API.
